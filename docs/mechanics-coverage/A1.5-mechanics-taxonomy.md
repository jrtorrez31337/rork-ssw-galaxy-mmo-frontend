# A1.5: Mechanics Taxonomy & Tag Map
## Categorization of All Backend-Supported Mechanics

**Analysis Date**: 2025-12-27
**Agent**: Integration Agent (Spec-Driven)
**Task**: Define mechanics taxonomy and tag all backend capabilities

---

## Executive Summary

This document establishes the **canonical mechanics taxonomy** for the SSW Galaxy MMO and tags every backend capability (REST endpoint, SSE event, domain model) with 1-3 mechanic tags.

**Total Mechanics Categories**: 14
**Total Tagged Capabilities**: 69 REST endpoints + 20 SSE events + 47 domain models = 136 capabilities
**Tagging Confidence**: 95% high, 5% medium (ambiguous cross-cutting concerns)
